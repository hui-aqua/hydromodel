# Hydrodynamic study on aquaculture cage with Code_Aster
---now it is a private project

summarize the hydrodynamic model for the aquaculture net
## Environments 
This folder contains the wave theory with reference article.

## Force model
Modules will be used in Code_Aster to generate the hydrodynamic forces.
Eleven models are implemented in this module and compared with the experimental data.
The details will be published soon.

## inputfilecreator
Used to creat the aster run files

## mesh creater
