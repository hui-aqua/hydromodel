[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/19931a0cd13143c29c7b26795031bc1f)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/hui-aqua/hydromodel?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=hui-aqua/hydromodel&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)---now it is not ready for release.
summarize the hydrodynamic model for the aquaculture net
## Environments 
This folder contains the wave theory with reference article.

## Force model
Modules will be used in Code_Aster to generate the hydrodynamic forces.
Eleven models are implemented in this module and compared with the experimental data.
The details will be published soon.

## inputfilecreator
Used to creat the aster run files

## mesh creater
script to generate the fish cage mesh in Solame
