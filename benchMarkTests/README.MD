# Benchmark tests
we prepared few cases for bench mark test
## How to run your first case

1. Generate mesh for code_aster. The mesh is automatically generated by typing the following command.

    ```aquaMesh [inputfile]```
2. Generate the necessary input files.
    
    ```aquaAster [inputfile]```
3. Run the simulation.

    ```aquaSim [inputfile]```
    
4. Check the results. Use ParaVis to read the .rmed file.
